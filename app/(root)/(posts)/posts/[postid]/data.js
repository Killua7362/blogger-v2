A giant face emerged from beneath the surface.

Sharp teeth peeking out of a gaping mouth, the corners of its mouth torn upward as if it was enjoying something.

It had no eyes or nose, so its expression was unreadable, but still recognizable.

The horrible feeling of hunger and thirst, the appetite, the gluttony, and the joy and elation that it was all about to be relieved.

The Daylilies of the Blood Tree waited beneath the water with their mouths open, waiting for the demons.

[Uuuuh?]

[Hey, what is this!?]

[Kuaaghh! What kind of power does it have!?]

[……Help me!]

The demon transformed into their bird of prey forms and took flight, only to be dragged back to the water’s surface by the tough vines that were about to wrap around their ankles, or had already wrapped around them.

Wahzak-.

The mouth of a Daylily closed.

One of the demons had gotten stuck in it and bled to death.

[……]

The demon shuddered as he looked down at his mashed up lower half, like meat for a haggis.

Crushed flesh, shattered bones, and dark blood dripped down in a puddle.

As its prey watched in horror and despair, Daylily shook itself with delight, stretching out its vines again and again.

Shurorororock-

Once again, the demons that had ascended to the sky are pulled down.

[When did these vines get around my ankles!?]

[Water! It got wrapped around me when I fell in the water!]

[I can’t get it off! Damn, it’s so tough!]

[Ouch! I’m being dragged again! Aaaaaaah…… kahg!?]

The countless daylilies soon formed a colony and swallowed up the demons.

cheombeong- cheombeong- cheombeong- cheombeong-

The river quickly turned black with the blood of the demons.

Seeing this disaster situation, Isolde could only gape.

His ankles, wings, and torso were covered with daylily vines as he struggled to hold on.

[No way! Where did these things……!?]

Isolde stared at Vikir with shaky pupils.

But Vikir didn’t bother to answer.

Before Madeline and her legion of demons had pursued Bianca, he had planted the seeds of the blood daylily on the shores of Lakedog, which had been drained for the construction of the dam.

‘No matter how bad the drought, the bottom of Lakedog Lake never cracks.’

Lakedog Lake hasn’t run dry in thousands of years.

When someone sees a lake like that, not only bare, but cracked and dry, they should be suspicious.

It’s because the daylily seeds have sprouted and sucked all the moisture from the bottom of the lake.

And now, with the water in full force, the daylilies are in full bloom.

They ate the demons in droves.

“You lacked attention.”

Isolde’s eyes widened at Vikir’s words.
